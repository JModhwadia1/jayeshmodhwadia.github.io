# My Porfolio Repo
This is a repo about the portfolio I have created as part of the Pro Dev module at Staffordshire University. I created the portfolio because it allows me me to demonstrate and show proof of the things i have achieved. I did this through Github as it allows easy edits of HTML and can easily access my own porfolio through here. Making any changes with Github can be solved in a cinch!
